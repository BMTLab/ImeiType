# .github/workflows/ci-main.yml

# Orchestrates the repository CI. Routes work to reusable workflows:
# - ci-build.yml (build/test/pack) on PRs and pushes to tracked branches.
# - ci-analyze.yml (CodeQL / .NET analyzes) as a separate job.
# - ci-upload-coverage.yml (Codecov upload) after build artifacts are produced.
# - ci-release.yml (NuGet + GitHub Release) on version tags (v*.*.*).
# Uses strict default permissions and per-ref concurrency to cancel superseded runs.
# Secrets passed through when needed: CODECOV_TOKEN, NUGET_API_KEY.

# This establishes a secure-by-default baseline, following the principle of least privilege.
# Any job that needs more permissions must explicitly request them, overriding this block.
