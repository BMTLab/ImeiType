# GitVersion configuration (using a minimal GitFlow-like approach).
# 
# This file sets how to calculate version numbers across different Git branches:
#  - main (stable releases, Patch increment by default),
#  - develop (pre-release: alpha, Minor increment),
#  - release (pre-release: beta),
#  - feature (inherits version rules from parent, uses branch name as a label),
#  - hotfix (pre-release: rc),
#  - pull-request (label: pr, inherits increment),
#  - unknown (fallback for any other branch).
#
# Global defaults are at the end of the file (e.g., mode = ContinuousDelivery).

strategies:
  # Fallback: ensures a version is generated even if no tag or commit indicates a change.
  - Fallback
  # ConfiguredNextVersion: allows manually specifying the next version in config (if used).
  - ConfiguredNextVersion
  # MergeMessage: increments version based on +semver: markers in merge commits.
  - MergeMessage
  # TaggedCommit: uses commit tags (e.g., v1.2.3) to anchor version numbers.
  - TaggedCommit
  # TrackReleaseBranches: detects release branches and increments version accordingly.
  - TrackReleaseBranches
  # VersionInBranchName: extracts version if branch name contains something like v1.2.3.
